## Template Source

> **Important**: All prompt templates in this project are inspired by and adapted from [AI-Assisted Software Development: A Comprehensive Guide with Practical Prompts](https://aalapdavjekar.medium.com/ai-assisted-software-development-a-comprehensive-guide-with-practical-prompts-part-1-3-989a529908e0) by Aalap Davjekar. We express our gratitude for the comprehensive guide that formed the foundation of our prompt system.

The templates cover various aspects of software development:
- Project initialization and planning
- Design and architecture decisions
- Implementation guidelines
- Optimization strategies
- Maintenance procedures

## Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Important Notes

- This project uses session storage, content will be cleared on page refresh
- It's recommended to browse the complete node list before use
- Templates can be freely switched between different phases as needed
